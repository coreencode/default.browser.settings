Browsers are user interfaces that make surfing the web enjoyable. They can be used to easily retrieve and display web content such as text documents, images, videos, and graphics. A lot has happened in terms of browsers since Microsoft first released Internet Explorer in 1995. Today, there are a variety of powerful browsers that offer users not only an engaging, but also secure web experience. Tracking protection, multi-level security settings, and privacy safeguards make this possible. The most popular and common browsers include:

* Mozilla Firefox
* Google Chrome
* Microsoft Edge
* Opera

In addition, there are browsers such as the specialized Opera GX gaming browser or the DuckDuckGo privacy browser, which is characterized by high security and privacy standards. Whichever your favorite browser is (maybe you even use several in parallel), you have one of them set as your default browser. Your operating system automatically uses a default browser for web applications (for example, to open documents) and bundles your web functions together. Thus, your default browser remembers frequently visited pages and preferred security settings, optimizing its functionality.
